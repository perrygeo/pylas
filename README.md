# pylas

*This code is no longer maintained*

Originally designed as a proof-of-concept for reading Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) 
data in binary LAS format and converting to GIS point data formats (xyz or shapefile). Today, there
are much better tools for using LIDAR in python code - this repo is for archival purposes only.
